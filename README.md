## Code
This directory contains Python scripts for the project. These scripts are provided for reproducibility purposes and are not executable without full environmental setup and data, e.g. base models and *Maracatu* dataset:
- `code/` 
  - `data/`: Raw and processed datasets used in the study, organized by instrument types. *Note: Maracatu dataset is available upon request to the authors as identified in the paper.*
  - `models/`: Trained models ready for evaluation. *Note: Base models (trained for onset detection `TCNv1` or beat tracking `TCNv2`) are available upon request to the authors as identified in the paper.*
  - `outputs/`: Output files from model runs, categorized by the musical tradition studied.
  - `pkl/`: Serialized Python objects related to the *Maracatu* datasets.
  - `src/`: Source code of the project.
    - `modules/`: Contains various Python modules for analysis, model definitions, and utilities.
  - `exports/`: Additional exportable resources or processed files.

## Installation
Clone this repository to view all files locally.

### Setting Up the Conda Environment

This project provides two Conda environment files: 
- `environment.yml` for macOS M1 users which includes specific versions for compatibility.
- `minimum_environment.yml` for users on other platforms, including only the core libraries needed across all systems.

This project uses a Conda environment to ensure all dependencies are managed correctly. The provided `environment.yml` file is tailored for compatibility with macOS M1 systems, which have specific requirements for TensorFlow and Keras versions. Other users are advised to start with the `minimum_environment.yml` and make any necessary adjustments based on their specific system requirements.

**For macOS M1 Users:**
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate maracatu
   ```

**For non-M1 Users:**
   ```bash
   conda env create -f minimum_environment.yml
   conda activate maracatu_minimum
   ```

Note: This will install all required packages via Conda and pip as specified in the environment file. Please review the package versions and adjust them as necessary.

## How to Rerun the Full Experiment Locally

1. Obtain Base Models

    Request the `.h5` base model files for TCNv1 and TCNv2 from the corresponding authors (as identified in the paper), and place them in the `/models` folder.

2. Obtain *Maracatu* dataset 
    
    Request the audio (`*.flac`) from dataset authors and place it in the `/data/**/audio` folder.

3. Run the Experiment Script

    ```bash
    python rerun_experiment.py
    ```
    This script: 
    - Fine-tunes models for each of Maracatu subdatasets.
    - Updates the ledger with new run IDs.
    - Saves finetuned models in the `/exports` folder with respective run IDs.
    - Creates predictions for each baseline model (madmomRNN, madmomCNN) and saves them in the `/exports` folder.
    - Creates original and finetuned model predictions for each Maracatu subdataset and saves them in the `/outputs` folder.


## Additional Figures and Tables
The `docs` folder is organized into two subdirectories to facilitate navigation and understanding

- `docs/figures/`, this folder contains boxplots (`*.pdf`) related to performance metrics like F-measure, Precision, and Recall:
    - Files are named following the convention: `<typeofplot>_<metric>_tol_<tolerance>.<basemodel>.pdf`
      - **typeofplot**: Type of the plot (e.g., `boxplot`)
      - **metric**: Performance metric (e.g., `fmeasure`, `precision`, `recall`)
      - **tolerance**: Tolerance levels indicating the timing precision required (e.g., `10ms`, `15ms`)
      - **basemodel**: The base model version used (e.g., `TCNv1`, `TCNv2`)
    - Examples:
      - `boxplot_fmeasure_tol_10ms.TCNv1.pdf`: Boxplot showing F-measure performance at 10ms tolerance using TCN version 1
      - `boxplot_precision_tol_25ms.TCNv2.pdf`: Boxplot showing Precision at 25ms tolerance using TCN version 2
      - Note: The figures whose names start with `compact_` are the ones used in the paper.

      These documents are provided in high quality to enhance detailed visualization and understanding, not possible within the limited size constraints of the paper.
- `docs/tables/`, this folder contains full tables (`*.pdf`) detailing performance metrics such as F-measure, Precision, and Recall, along with counts of True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN) across the *Maracatu* dataset for baseline and finetuned models on the TCNv1 and TCNv2 network.
